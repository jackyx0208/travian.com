Countless days have passed since the first battles upon
the walls of the cursed villages of the dreaded Natars,
many armies of both the free ones and the Natarian empire
struggled and died before the walls of the many
strongholds from which the Natars had once ruled all
creation. Now with the dust settled and as a tentative
sense of calm spread among the remaining soldiers, armies
began to count their losses and collect their dead, the
stench of combat still lingering in the night air, a smell
of a slaughter unforgettable in its extent and brutality
soon to be dwarfed by yet others. The largest armies of
the free tribes were preparing for another attack, and the
fearsome Natars were marshalling their defences for yet
another renewed assault upon the coveted former
strongholds of the Natarian Empire.
<br><br>
Soon, scouts arrived with tales of a most awesome sight
and a chilling reminder; a dreaded army of an unfathomable
size had been spotted treading its path towards the very
end of the world, the Natarian capital, a force so great
that the dust from their march would choke off all light,
a force so brutal and ruthless that it would crush all
hope. The free people knew thay they had to do the
impossible; race against time and the endless hordes of
the Natarian Empire to raise a Wonder of the World in
order to restore peace to the world and vanquish the
Natarian threat once and for all.
<br><br>
But to raise such a great Wonder would be no easy task;
one would need construction plans created and long
forgotten in the distant past, plans of such an arcane
nature that even the very wisest of sages knew not their
contents or locations.
<br><br>
Tens of thousands of scouts roamed across all existence
searching in vain for these mystical plans, looking in all
places but the dreaded Natarian Capital, yet could not
find them. Today however, they return baring good news;
the locations of the plans have finally been discovered,
concealed by the armies of the Natars inside secret
strongholds, purposefully constructed to be hidden from
the eyes of man.
<br><br>
Now begins the final stretch, when the greatest armies of
the free peoples and the Natars will clash upon the
largest battlefields of the world to decide the fate of
all that lies under heaven. Sword against sword, this is
the war that will echo across the eons; this is your war,
and here you shall etch your name across history. Here you
shall become legend...

<b>Facts:</b><i>To steal one, the following things must
happen:</i><br>
<li>You must attack the village (NO Raid!)</li>
<li>WIN the Attack</li>
<li>Destroy the treasury</li>
<li>Hero must participate in an attack</li>
<li>An empty treasury level 10 MUST be in the village
where that attack came from</li>
<br><br>
If not, the next attack on that village, winning with a
hero and empty treasury will take the building plan.
<br><br>
To build a WW, you must own a plan yourself (you = the WW
village owner) from level 0 to 49, from 50 to 100 you need
an additional plan, belonging to a player in your
alliance! Two Plans in the WW village account wonÂ´t work!

            <p style="font-size:85%; text-align:justify; width:400px">
                Whispered rumours echo throughout the villages, pertaining
                legends told only by the best of storytellers. They
                concern the Natars, Travianâs most fearsome warriors. It
                is every heroâs dream to slay them, every soldierâs goal.
                No one knows how the Natars grew to be so powerful, their
                soldiers so fearsome. Determined to discover the source of
                their power, an elite group of scouts is sent out to spy
                on them.  They return a few hours later with terrified
                faces and wild theories: it seems the Natarsâ power comes
                from mysterious items they call artefacts, which they had
                stolen from your ancestors. Manage to steal the artefacts,
                they say, and you can steal their power.
                <br><br><img src="img/msg.jpg"
                             alt="Artefacts" width="400" height="200" style="float:
right">
                <br><br>
                The time has come to reclaim the artefacts. Conspire with
                your alliance and assemble your warriors to retrieve these
                coveted objects. However, the Natars will not give the
                artefacts up without a fightâ¦ and neither shall your
                enemies. If you can manage to successfully repossess the
                artefacts and fend off your enemies, then you will be able
                to reap the rewards. Your buildings shall become
                incredibly strong and powerful, your troops much faster
                and more crop-efficient. Seize the artefacts, bring glory
                to your empire, and become the new legends for your
                successors.

â There is always a reason for a ban. Try to think about possible reasons for this ban and put things straight with the Multihunter.

â Multihunters can review enormous amounts of information about accounts. Stick to the truth and do not make excuses to justify your violation of the rules.
</br>
â Be cooperative and insightful, this might reduce the punishment.
</br>
â If the Multihunter does not answer immediately, then he/she is probably not online.</br>
 The issue will not be resolved any faster by sending multiple messages, especially if he/she did not even read the first one yet.

</br></br>You have been banned due to %s. Every players may only own and play one account on each server.
</br></br>To ensure that you won`t get banned again in future, you should read the rules carefully:
</br></br><center><a href="http://' . WebService::getJustDomain() . 'spielregeln.php">Â» Game rules</a></center>
</br></br></br>
To continue playing you should wait to %s or contact the Multihunter and put things straight with him/her
</br></br><center><a href="messages.php?t=1&id=2">Â» Write message</a></center>
</br></br>
Head the following advise when writing your message:
</br></br>
â There is always a reason for a ban. Try to think about possible reasons for this ban and put things straight with the Multihunter.
</br>
â Multihunters can review enormous amounts of information about accounts. Stick to the truth and do not make excuses to justify your violation of the rules.
</br>
â Be cooperative and insightful, this might reduce the punishment.
</br>
â If the Multihunter does not answer immediately, then he/she is probably not online.</br>
 The issue will not be resolved any faster by sending multiple messages, especially if he/she did not even read the first one yet.
</br>
â If you have really been banned unjustly, try to stay calm and polite while talking to the Multihunter and telling him/her about your point of view.

Hello %s,<br><br>
<br><br>
Travian is a game of domination through strategy and diplomacy. At the core, it is about standing up against other players. Seek allies to reach your goals; even the strongest players require assistance.<br><br>
<br><br>
The predominant task is always to survive and grow. In order to start on a sound footing, simply solve the tasks I give you. Protect your resources and villages from greedy neighbours. In case you are struggling, you can find some additional help here: <a href="{$answersUrl}index.php?aid=104#go2answer">Help I am a farm!</a><br><br>
<br><br>
At the start, you can often avoid enemy attacks, however you should defend yourself against conquer attempts. Without troops, you won't be able to help yourself nor your allies. More information here: <a href="{$answersUrl}index.php?aid=172#go2answer">Troops</a><br><br>
<br><br>
Once the dust of the first battles has settled, the strongest alliances will start fighting for control of ever larger territories. They will destroy threats and competitors and form new alliances. Particularly strong alliances will later fight for control of powerful artefacts and - as a display of their own power - to be the first to erect a wonder of the world.<br><br>
<br><br>
Adjust your personal goals to the time you can spend playing - the more ambitious your aims, the more time will be required to build, negotiate and fight.<br><br>
<br><br>
But enough talking! Get together with old and new friends, fight your enemies - and have fun together!
